# Cloud IaC and VPC 5 Day Sprint - Sparta Education

- I undertook a 5 day sprit with Sparta Education to deepen my understanding of the Cloud and AWS.
- I got hands on experience creating VPCs while creating public and private butnets within them.
- I also used Terraform to automate the work of creating the VPC and related component that I previously had to do manually.
